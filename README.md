# Meta wants to supercharge Wikipedia with an AI upgrade

### What's cool about this article:

We've all referred to Wikipedia for assignments over the years, whether we admit it or not. What's great about it is the extensive amount of articles it has on a wide range of topics - because it is crowd-sourced knowledge and anyone can contribute to it. But that is precisely also the problem most professors would have with it - _anyone can contribute to it._

Anyone can write whatever they feel like on it, and it could get passed as gospel. Of course, there is a citation system in place. But people could easily get past this, and provide irrelevant citations with misleading information or just have the incorrect sources for some true fact.

Meta, using its Meta AI lab, wants to change this with a machine learning model they have developed to check if the citations actually support the claims. 

> Trained using a dataset consisting of 4 million Wikipedia citations, Meta’s new tool is able to effectively analyze the information linked to a citation and then cross-reference it with the supporting evidence. And this isn’t just a straightforward text string comparison, either.

The article has many great details about the training and future of this model. This is still a work in progress but if they are able to perfect this technology then who knows, maybe one day Wikipedia **will** be an accepted source for assignments!
